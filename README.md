### Idea Creation

Finding a ride at Carleton can often be tricky. Uber doesn't come to campus and Lyft is very expensive. At the beginning and end of the term, student Facebook pages are often flooded with requests for rides. However, many posts get lost and go unanswered, even when there are other Carleton students willing to help. To solve this problem, we set out to create an easy-to-use platform for Carleton students to request a ride or drive a fellow student in need. After all, Carls help Carls!

### How it Works

Need a ride? Click "Rider". Fill out the form and wait for someone to email or call you back!
Willing to drive? Click "Driver" and sign up to receive email notifications when new rides are posted. You can also browse the RideBoard to see current ride requests.
